# Credit Check :white_check_mark:

This project leads to building a machine learning model to predict probability of a client's credit status before requesting a loan. First, python is used to gather and clean a dataset. Afterwards, the cleaned dataset is loaded into WEKA to perform a comparison between machine learning models to determine and build the most accurate one.
